        <h2>Ghost Communicating Devices</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP)</h3>
            <p>EVP are mysterious voices captured on recordings, believed to be messages from spirits. Paranormal investigators use audio recorders to capture these voices during their investigations. The voices often range from faint whispers to clear, articulate messages, adding to the eerie nature of EVP.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Common questions asked during EVP sessions include: "Is anyone here?" and "What is your name?"</li>
                <li>EVP sessions are often conducted in known haunted locations to increase the likelihood of capturing spirit voices.</li>
                <li>Some believe that spirits use the energy of the recording device to communicate, making it essential to have high-quality equipment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Spirit Boxes</h3>
            <p>Spirit boxes are devices that scan radio frequencies to pick up spirit communications. They produce a continuous stream of white noise, which spirits can manipulate to form words and sentences. Paranormal investigators use spirit boxes during their investigations to ask questions and receive real-time responses.</p>
            <p>Spirit box sessions can be conducted in any location, but they are most effective in places with a known history of paranormal activity. Investigators often ask direct questions and listen carefully for any coherent responses amidst the white noise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>EMF Meters</h3>
            <p>EMF meters detect electromagnetic fields, which are believed to be indicators of paranormal activity. Sudden spikes in EMF readings often suggest the presence of a spirit. Paranormal investigators use EMF meters to detect and track these anomalies, helping them identify potential paranormal hotspots.</p>
